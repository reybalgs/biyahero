_The Philippine commuter's companion_

## What is ``Biyahero''?

Biyahero is an Android application that aids people planning or are commuting
in the Philippines, more specifically Metro Manila. It does so by:

### Calculating best commuting route

By gathering mass transit data such as stops, routes, fare matrices, and
traffic conditions from a constantly-updated central server, BiyaHero can
calculate the best commuting route (i.e. a set of public transits the user must
take) and suggest them to the user. Not only that, Biyahero can also...

### Get updates on the currently travelled route

While the user is travelling one of the specified routes, BiyaHero will
constantly get updates from numerous data sources to evaluate the current
route. For example, if there's a traffic jam a few kilometers ahead due to an
inconvenient traffic accident, BiyaHero will immediately inform the user and
suggest alternatives.

### View information on major public transport options

Not everybody is familiar with the major transport options in the Metro, and
asking around can only get you so much information. BiyaHero provides its users
with up-to-date information regarding the major public transport options in the
Metro, like buses, jeepneys and elevated rail transit (LRT and MRT).
